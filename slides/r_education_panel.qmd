## Panel Today
 
Panel convener: Joy Payton

Additional Panelists:

* Ray Balise
* Silvia Canelón
* Meghan Harris 
* Ted Laderas


We'll have a few questions to get started but we want to engage with you, so please use chat liberally!

::: notes

Hi everyone, my name is Joy Payton, I use she/her pronouns, and I am the convener of this panel.  I'm a data science educator in biomedicine and I brought together other educators who work in different areas of the same field, to talk about a topic I think a lot of us care about, which is how to support people who are trying to learn R at work, while they're busy doing lots of other things.  And we're trying to do this now in what I've euphemistically called "Interesting Times".

I'm going to ask the panelists to introduce themselves and what their primary educational audience is, and I'll do that in alphabetical order by last name, and then I'll start asking a couple of questions.  Then I'd love to open it up to you, our participants, to engage with us, and make this a dialog.

Let's get started with our first panelist!

::: notes
OK, and this is my slide, I'm Joy, and I'm in transition mode, which I'll talk about later on in the panel, but while at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, which we call CHOP, some of what I've done has been to teach lots of different kind of data science topics within CHOP and beyond CHOP, as part of an NIH-funded data science training program where we reached learners in 16 countries.  I also work in global health informatics and I occasionally pick up a side gig doing adjunct work or lecturing for O'Reilly.

## Question 1

> Vibe coding and using LLMs to write code is enjoying a lot of press these days.  Is it still necessary to teach people to write R code, and if so, how much?

::: notes

So, let's start with this one.  Panelists, I'll let you come off mute as you see fit to answer in the order you wish.  Vibe coding and using LLMs to write code is enjoying a lot of press these days.  Is it still necessary to teach people to write R code, and if so, how much?

## Question 2

> The title of this panel mentions "interesting times".  What is making your work as an educator particularly interesting these days, whether that's good or bad?

::: notes

Let's move on to another question.  The title of this panel mentions "interesting times".  What is making your work as an educator particularly interesting these days, whether that's good or bad?  Panelists, what do you think?

:::

## Question 3

> What are some of the tools and methods you find most effective to get people to use their skills and retain their use?

::: notes

Here's a question I think a lot of people will find useful when it comes to applying R to real life work.  What are some of the tools and methods you find most effective to get people to use their skills and retain their use?
